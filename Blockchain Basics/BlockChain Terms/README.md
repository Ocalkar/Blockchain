**Bitcoin & Blockchain**
Blockchain is the secure way to handle transactions. Blockchain uses the cryptography to ensure integrity.
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency(digital money) which is digital implementation of Blockchain technology.

**Why do we use Blockchain?**

Customer and vendor payment issues can be solved with the blockchain.

Blockchain desentrialzed and open ledger. Ledger is records of transactions done. Because of the transactions are visibe to everyone we can call it 
Blockchain features include exchanging value without trust, eleminating middleman, efficiency, resilience and transparency.

**What is the chain of blocks?**

The Genesis Block or block 0 is the first block of the blockchain. Each blocks linked by soring the previous block's hash. If data in any block , this changes its hash value, then breaks the link between to each block. This is the way that how we can tell if any data has been changed  along anywhere of the blockchain. Hashes make blockchain work. Nonce is a value added to block data to create new hash.

**Smart Contract Languages**
Solidity
Mutan
LLL
Serpent
Bamboo
Viper(Simplicity and security)

**EVM(Ethereum Virtual Machine)**
EVM is present in all nodes and EVM keeps each node syncronized . 
EVM provides smart contract execution. This is only way to access blockchain. 


**Gas**
Cryptocurrency cost of accessing blockchain. Gas unit is Wei (10^-18 ETH)
Gas limits reduce denial of service(DOS) attacks and incentivice developers to create efficient smart contract code.

**Ethereum SDLC Tools**
Ethereum blockchain client
Development/testing blockchain
Compiler/testing framework
IDE

**Blockchain Client**
BC is a software that runs on EVM that makes a device a node on the Ethereum blockchain.

BC supports Ethereum Standarts and rules and enforce them on each node.

Runs the EVM on a node.

**Some of Ethereum Blockchain clients:**

CPP Ethereum  >> C++

Ethereumjs-lib  >> js

Geth(Go Ethereum) >> Go

Parity >>Rust

Pyethapp >> Python
