**What is Smart Conract?**

Smart contract is a block of code that controls actions taken on blockchain data for solving the real world problems on blockchain.

**Supply Chain Challenges & Blockchain**

Supply Chain is the workflow of products or services from product to consumer is one of excellent use case of blockchain.


There are many stakeholders in a typical supply chain. So it is important that detecting each steps of supply chain. Smart conract helps solving transfer time lag, figuring out where the translation point of any data loss, desentralized status tracking of a supply chain.

**Steps to Create a Smart Contract for a basic supply chain project**

Develop 2 smart contracts. First one is for definition a token for payment. Second one is asset tracking and management. 

Development Steps :

1 - Creating a new supply chain stakeholder / participant.

2 - Adding a new product to supply chain.

3 - Transfering ownership of a product to another participant.

4 - Tracking a product.

**Ethereum Tokens**

A token is a smart contract for a particular project and using an existing blockchain. Tokens are generally developed and used by startups or organisations looking to raise funds for their new projects, generally in the blockchain space.

Some of the most popular token standards on Ethereum:

ERC-20 - A standard interface for fungible (interchangeable) tokens, like voting tokens, staking tokens or virtual currencies.

ERC-721 - A standard interface for non-fungible tokens, like a deed for artwork or a song.

ERC-777 - ERC-777 allows people to build extra functionality on top of tokens such as a mixer contract for improved transaction privacy or an emergency recover function to bail you out if you lose your private keys.

ERC-1155 - ERC-1155 allows for more efficient trades and bundling of transactions â€“ thus saving costs. This token standard allows for creating both utility tokens (such as $BNB or $BAT) and Non-Fungible Tokens like CryptoPunks.

**Comparation of ERC20, TRC20 and BEP20 Tokens**

Ethereum, Binance (Binance Smart Chain), and TRON are three of the most popular blockchains used for crypto token development. They use ERC-20, BEP-20, and TRC-20 token standards respectively.
